Bulk removing tags is a common task that Shopify merchants might need to perform at some point. We are introducing a new type of product tag operations in Tag Genie called **Scenarios**. Scenarios are specifically built to enable our users to perform common tags as easy as possible.

Here we are introducing the Bulk Tag Remove scenario which allows tags to be remove with just a few clicks. 

In order to use this scenario, click the "**Create Tag Operations**" button is Tag Genie and select the **Bulk Remove Tags** operations. On the next page, just click on the tags that you would like to remove, preview the tags changes, and confirm the operation to have the tags removed.
